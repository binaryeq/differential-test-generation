the main class is `io.github.bineq.featurecomp.CompareFeatures`, 
expected arguments are the locations of the alternative build index files, like:
`gav_mvnc.tsv gav_gaoss.tsv gav_obfs.tsv`. Results are saved in `results`. 

Only results for "interesting" combinations are saved (some classes must be different).
