# Test Generation for Differential Testing of Alternately Built Java Binaries

Use [randoop](https://randoop.github.io/randoop/) to automatically generate regression tests for the [altbuilds dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13743624) and apply them to different providers.

Details are described in this paper: *Dietrich, Jens, Tim White, Valerio Terragni, and Behnaz Hassanshahi. "Towards Cross-Build Differential Testing." In 2025 IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST), pp. 592-596. IEEE, 2025.*
